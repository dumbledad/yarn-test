# Yarn Test

Just me playing around to understand Yarn a bit

# Notes

- [.gitignore](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored)
- `yarn set version stable` locks the yarn version used by this project to the latest stable version ([docs](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/set/version))
